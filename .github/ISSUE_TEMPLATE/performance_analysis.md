## Task Description

Create a detailed analysis of the model's performance across different conditions and scenarios, focusing on detection accuracy and reliability.

### Objectives

1. Analyze model performance across:

   - Different lighting conditions
   - Various crater sizes
   - Different lunar regions
   - Challenging scenarios

2. Compare results with:
   - Manual annotations
   - Existing lunar research
   - Expected geological patterns

### Implementation Steps

1. Create a new script `analyze_performance.py` that will:

   - Process detection results
   - Calculate performance metrics
   - Generate comparative analysis
   - Create detailed visualizations

2. Document findings in:
   - Technical report
   - Performance metrics
   - Visual comparisons
   - Recommendations for improvement

### Expected Deliverables

1. New Python script for performance analysis
2. Comprehensive report including:
   - Performance metrics by condition
   - Statistical analysis
   - Visual comparisons
   - Error analysis
3. Recommendations for model improvement
4. Updated documentation

### Technical Requirements

- Python with data analysis libraries
- Understanding of model metrics
- Access to test results and annotations

### Success Criteria

- Detailed performance analysis
- Clear statistical documentation
- Visual representation of findings
- Actionable recommendations
- Code follows project style guidelines

### Resources

- Model predictions and annotations
- Existing documentation
- Project style guide
- Test results

### Timeline

- Data analysis: 1 week
- Report creation: 1 week
- Documentation and review: 1 week

### Notes
