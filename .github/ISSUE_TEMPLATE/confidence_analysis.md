## Task Description

Create a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the model's detection confidence scores for lunar craters.

### Objectives

1. Extract confidence scores from model predictions
2. Create visualizations showing:
   - Distribution of confidence scores
   - Relationship between crater size and confidence
   - Geographic patterns in confidence levels
   - False positive vs true positive confidence distributions

### Implementation Steps

1. Modify `show_detections.py` to output confidence scores
2. Create a new script `analyze_confidence.py` that will:
   - Process confidence scores from detections
   - Generate visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn
   - Calculate statistical measures
   - Create a detailed analysis report

### Expected Deliverables

1. New Python script for confidence analysis
2. Visualizations showing:
   - Histogram of confidence scores
   - Scatter plot of crater size vs confidence
   - Heatmap of confidence by image region
3. Statistical analysis report
4. Updated documentation

### Technical Requirements

- Python with matplotlib/seaborn
- Access to model predictions
- Understanding of confidence scores in YOLOv5

### Success Criteria

- Clear visualizations of confidence patterns
- Statistical analysis of confidence distributions
- Documentation of findings
- Code follows project style guidelines

### Resources

- Existing detection code in `scripts/show_detections.py`
- Model predictions and annotations
- Project documentation and style guide

### Timeline

- Initial implementation: 1 week
- Analysis and visualization: 1 week
- Documentation and review: 1 week

### Notes

- Focus on clear, interpretable visualizations
- Include statistical analysis of patterns
- Document any interesting findings
- Follow project coding standards
